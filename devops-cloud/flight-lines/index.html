                  <h1>Flight Lines</h1>
<h2>Theoretical Ground</h2>
<p>Knowledge gets organized into <strong>domains</strong>—epidemiology, jazz theory, mycology, contract law. These are stratifications: useful for organizing expertise but not fundamental boundaries. They&#39;re territories.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong> exist beneath these strata. &quot;Sentinel surveillance&quot; isn&#39;t essentially about disease—it&#39;s a capacity: strategic monitoring of high-signal locations in sparse search spaces. &quot;Reharmonization&quot; isn&#39;t essentially about jazz—it&#39;s changing underlying structure while preserving surface continuity. Operations are <strong>deterritorialized capacities</strong> that got captured by domain-strata through historical accident.</p>
<p>The conventional approach to problems stays within domain boundaries. Dating advice for dating problems. Language pedagogy for language problems. This is navigating along the strata—safe, predictable, limited.</p>
<p><strong>Lines of flight</strong> are movements that escape stratified territories. When you recognize that rare book dealer &quot;want list circulation&quot; addresses the same structural constraint as epidemiological &quot;contact tracing&quot;—and both could apply to finding collaborators in a new city—you&#39;re accessing operations on a <strong>plane of consistency</strong> where domain labels don&#39;t constrain what composes with what.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight</strong>: Operations compose based on structural fit, not semantic coherence. An assemblage of mycorrhizal networks + ham radio + rare book collecting is domain-incoherent but can be structurally coherent for a given problem.</p>
<h2>What This Enables</h2>
<p><strong>Stratified approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: &quot;I just moved to a new city and want to build a life here&quot;</li>
<li>Solution space: Networking advice, meetup apps, &quot;put yourself out there&quot;</li>
<li>Limitation: Stays within conventional self-help territory</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compositional approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify parallel concerns: shelter/territory, social/connection, work/sustenance, identity/becoming</li>
<li>For each concern, identify structural constraints (not semantic categories)</li>
<li>Query for operations addressing those constraints from ANY domain</li>
<li>Compose operations that work together, revising as structure changes</li>
<li>Result: Novel assemblage that couldn&#39;t emerge from any single domain</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<h3>Operation</h3>
<p>A specific capacity with defined mechanics—not a concept or metaphor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it acts on</strong>: Input structure</li>
<li><strong>What it produces</strong>: Output structure</li>
<li><strong>What it preserves</strong>: Invariants under the transformation</li>
<li><strong>What it transforms</strong>: What necessarily changes</li>
<li><strong>How you execute it</strong>: Concrete procedure</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentinel surveillance</strong> (epidemiology): Monitor high-signal nodes to detect sparse events early</li>
<li><strong>Mycelial resource sharing</strong> (mycology): Distribute resources through network based on need signals</li>
<li><strong>Want list circulation</strong> (rare books): Broadcast specific search criteria through dealer networks</li>
<li><strong>CQ calls</strong> (ham radio): General broadcast seeking any responder, establishes who&#39;s listening</li>
<li><strong>Nurse logs</strong> (forest ecology): Use decaying structure as substrate for new growth</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing</strong> (distributed systems): Distribute work across nodes to prevent bottlenecks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structural Constraint</h3>
<p>A property of the problem that creates difficulty—independent of domain framing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sparse signal in noise (most encounters are mismatches)</li>
<li>Cold start (no existing network to leverage)</li>
<li>Resource scarcity (limited time, energy, money)</li>
<li>Information asymmetry (can&#39;t identify compatible parties externally)</li>
<li>Temporal dynamics (windows of opportunity, decay rates)</li>
<li>Network topology (fragmented patches, no clear hubs)</li>
<li>Identity flux (who you&#39;re becoming isn&#39;t who you were)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assemblage</h3>
<p>A composition of heterogeneous operations that work together. Assemblages don&#39;t require domain coherence—they require <strong>structural coherence</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each operation addresses different constraints</li>
<li>Operations don&#39;t contradict each other</li>
<li>Together they form executable protocol</li>
<li>Domain mixing is expected, not anomalous</li>
</ul>
<h3>Line of Flight</h3>
<p>A trajectory that escapes stratified solutions. When standard approaches feel exhausted and you start pulling operations from mycology and espionage and thermodynamics to address your problem—you&#39;re following a line of flight.</p>
<p>Not all lines of flight succeed. Some dissipate, some get recaptured by strata, some open genuine new territory.</p>
<h2>The Compositional Method</h2>
<p>This is not a linear pipeline. It&#39;s an ongoing process with parallel paths and constant revision.</p>
<h3>1. Map the Terrain</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t ask &quot;what kind of problem is this?&quot; (that&#39;s seeking a stratum to navigate within).</p>
<p>Ask: &quot;What are the parallel concerns here? What structural properties make each one hard?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Example: Fresh Start in a New City</strong></p>
<p>An adult has moved to a new city. They want to build a life—not just survive, but flourish. Not replicate their old life, but become someone new while honoring who they&#39;ve been.</p>
<p>Parallel concerns identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Territory</strong>: Physical space, shelter, navigable environment</li>
<li><strong>Sustenance</strong>: Income, work, economic participation</li>
<li><strong>Connection</strong>: Social bonds, community, belonging</li>
<li><strong>Orientation</strong>: Understanding how this place works, its rhythms and norms</li>
<li><strong>Becoming</strong>: Identity work—who are you here, without old context?</li>
</ul>
<p>For each concern, structural constraints:</p>
<p><strong>Territory constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resource scarcity (housing costs, competition)</li>
<li>Information asymmetry (locals know what you don&#39;t)</li>
<li>Temporal pressure (need shelter immediately)</li>
<li>Quality uncertainty (can&#39;t assess neighborhood without living there)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Connection constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cold start (no existing network)</li>
<li>Sparse matching (most people aren&#39;t compatible for deep connection)</li>
<li>Context collapse (no shared history to build on)</li>
<li>Activation energy (initiating contact is costly)</li>
<li>Decay dynamics (new connections fade without maintenance)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becoming constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identity flux (old identity doesn&#39;t fit, new one not yet formed)</li>
<li>Legibility gap (others can&#39;t read you without context)</li>
<li>Self-coherence pressure (need continuity while changing)</li>
<li>Scaffolding absence (no existing structures support new becoming)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Query for Operations (Broadly)</h3>
<p>For each structural constraint, ask: &quot;What operations address this structural property?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t constrain by domain.</strong> Query across everything you understand.</p>
<p><strong>Cold start constraint</strong> (no existing network):</p>
<p>Operations that address cold start:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spore dispersal</strong> (mycology): Broadcast widely, most fail, some find substrate</li>
<li><strong>CQ calls</strong> (ham radio): General broadcast announcing presence, seeing who responds</li>
<li><strong>Seed banks</strong> (ecology): Dormant connections that activate when conditions right</li>
<li><strong>Pioneer species</strong> (succession ecology): First colonizers that make environment habitable for others</li>
<li><strong>Loss leaders</strong> (retail): Offer value at cost to establish presence, profit comes later</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sparse matching constraint</strong> (most people aren&#39;t compatible):</p>
<p>Operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentinel surveillance</strong> (epidemiology): Monitor high-signal locations rather than random search</li>
<li><strong>Want list circulation</strong> (rare books): Broadcast specific criteria to networks, let matches come to you</li>
<li><strong>Assortative mixing</strong> (network science): Seek environments where similar nodes cluster</li>
<li><strong>Pheromone trails</strong> (entomology): Leave signals that attract compatible others</li>
<li><strong>Resonance testing</strong> (acoustics): Send signal, see what vibrates back</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identity flux constraint</strong> (old identity doesn&#39;t fit):</p>
<p>Operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nurse logs</strong> (forest ecology): Old structure provides substrate for new growth</li>
<li><strong>Molting</strong> (arthropods): Shed constraining exterior, vulnerable period, new form emerges</li>
<li><strong>Composting</strong> (soil science): Break down old material into nutrients for new growth</li>
<li><strong>Version control</strong> (software): Maintain history while enabling change, can branch and merge</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic switching</strong> (biochemistry): Same organism, different mode of operation based on environment</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Compose Assemblages (Parallel Paths)</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t create one master plan. <strong>Open multiple lines simultaneously.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Line A: Territorial Establishment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pioneer species + Nurse logs: Find transitional housing that scaffolds while you learn the terrain</li>
<li>Sentinel surveillance: Identify high-signal neighborhoods (not &quot;best&quot; neighborhoods—ones that match your becoming)</li>
<li>Pheromone trails: As you explore, leave traces—become a regular somewhere, let patterns form</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Line B: Network Seeding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CQ calls + Spore dispersal: Make presence known broadly—some venues, some online, some professional contexts</li>
<li>Assortative mixing: Seek environments that pre-filter for compatibility (not &quot;networking events&quot;—specific interest clusters)</li>
<li>Want list circulation: Tell people specifically what you&#39;re looking for (collaborators on X, people interested in Y)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Line C: Becoming Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Molting + Nurse logs: Let old identity provide nutrients for new one rather than clinging or rejecting</li>
<li>Version control: Maintain continuity—you&#39;re not starting from zero, you&#39;re branching</li>
<li>Metabolic switching: Different contexts may call for different modes (professional you, social you, exploring you)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Execute and Observe</h3>
<p>Run operations. Generate concrete outputs:</p>
<p><strong>CQ calls executed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attended three different interest-based gatherings (ceramics studio open house, philosophy reading group, climbing gym)</li>
<li>Posted in local subreddit introducing yourself with specific interests</li>
<li>Told everyone you met one specific thing you&#39;re looking for</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sentinel surveillance executed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identified three &quot;high-signal&quot; locations: the coffee shop where interesting conversations happen, the co-working space with creative energy, the park where your demographic clusters</li>
<li>Started regular presence at one (become a pattern, not a visitor)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Want list circulation executed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Told five people: &quot;I&#39;m looking for collaborators interested in [specific thing]&quot;</li>
<li>Created a simple artifact (blog post, project page, newsletter) that broadcasts your criteria</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nurse log executed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brought three objects from old life that carry meaning</li>
<li>Reached out to two old friends not to maintain old dynamic but to share new becoming</li>
<li>Identified which skills/knowledge from past are substrate for new growth</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Revise Based on New Structure</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s where the <strong>composer</strong> aspect becomes dynamic.</p>
<p>Execution changes structure. New structure reveals new constraints. New constraints suggest new operations.</p>
<p><strong>After two weeks:</strong></p>
<p>What emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>The philosophy reading group has a subgroup interested in exactly your thing → Line B intensifies here</li>
<li>Your transitional housing is in a neighborhood that doesn&#39;t fit → Line A needs revision</li>
<li>You&#39;re trying to maintain old identity more than you realized → Line C reveals deeper constraint</li>
</ul>
<p>New constraints revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premature crystallization</strong>: Danger of locking into first connections rather than staying open</li>
<li><strong>Energy depletion</strong>: Too many parallel lines, not enough intensity on any</li>
<li><strong>Authenticity drag</strong>: Presenting self in ways that attract wrong matches</li>
</ul>
<p>New operations pulled in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controlled burns</strong> (forestry): Deliberately clear some undergrowth to allow new growth</li>
<li><strong>Dormancy</strong> (botany): Some seeds should wait for better conditions rather than germinating now</li>
<li><strong>Impedance matching</strong> (electronics): Adjust your presentation to match the systems you&#39;re connecting to</li>
</ul>
<p>Revised assemblage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Narrow from three lines to two (let one go dormant)</li>
<li>Intensify philosophy group line (impedance match—show up as someone becoming, not someone arrived)</li>
<li>Controlled burn on housing—actively reject current situation rather than tolerating, reopen search</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Iterate Until Stable (Or Transform the Question)</h3>
<p>The process continues until:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stable assemblage</strong>: Operations are working, concerns addressed, sustainable configuration achieved</li>
<li><strong>Question transforms</strong>: The becoming work changes what you&#39;re even trying to do—you&#39;re now asking different questions</li>
<li><strong>Reterritorialization</strong>: You&#39;ve found a new stratum that works—this is fine, not everything needs to stay deterritorialized</li>
</ul>
<p>The composer doesn&#39;t have an end state. It&#39;s a way of navigating.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<h3>Operations Are Deterritorialized Capacities</h3>
<p>&quot;Sentinel surveillance&quot; works whether tracking disease, monitoring rare species, or finding your people in a new city. The operation exists independent of its origin domain.</p>
<p>When you use an operation, you&#39;re not doing &quot;epidemiology&quot; in your social life. You&#39;re accessing a capacity that epidemiology happened to articulate.</p>
<h3>Compose on Structure, Not Semantics</h3>
<p>Mycorrhizal networks + ham radio + rare books is semantically absurd. It can be structurally coherent.</p>
<p>Domain mixing isn&#39;t a clever trick—it&#39;s the natural result of accessing operations beneath their domain-strata.</p>
<h3>Parallel Lines, Constant Revision</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t create a master plan and execute it. Open multiple lines. Let some intensify, let some dissipate. Revise as structure changes.</p>
<p>The composer is an ongoing process, not a one-shot planner.</p>
<h3>Execution Produces Structure</h3>
<p>You can&#39;t fully analyze a problem then solve it. Execution reveals constraints analysis missed. Operations produce structure that suggests new operations.</p>
<p>Think: probe, act, sense, respond. Not: analyze, plan, execute.</p>
<h3>Operations Feed Back</h3>
<p>The output of one operation becomes input for selecting the next. &quot;Want list circulation&quot; might surface someone who teaches you about &quot;guild structures&quot; (medieval crafts), which becomes a new operation addressing constraints you hadn&#39;t seen.</p>
<p>Domains you didn&#39;t know could contribute get pulled in as you go.</p>
<h3>Trust Computational Fidelity</h3>
<p>If you can generate concrete outputs—specific actions, real artifacts, actual protocols—the composition is working.</p>
<p>Vague analogies (&quot;my social life is like a mycelial network&quot;) aren&#39;t operations. Specific procedures (&quot;broadcast specific criteria through existing contacts, let matches come to you&quot;) are.</p>
<h2>When to Use This</h2>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem has multiple parallel concerns (not single-axis optimization)</li>
<li>Standard approaches feel exhausted or constraining</li>
<li>You sense the problem wants a different kind of solution</li>
<li>You have operational fluency in seemingly unrelated domains</li>
<li>You&#39;re willing to follow lines that look weird</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t use when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem is well-served by domain-standard solutions</li>
<li>Stakes require proven approaches</li>
<li>You want conventional advice</li>
<li>Single constraint, obvious operation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Patterns</h2>
<h3>Pattern: Parallel Lines with Selective Intensification</h3>
<p>Open multiple lines. Most won&#39;t go anywhere. A few will resonate. Intensify those, let others go dormant or dissipate.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t pick one approach and commit. Don&#39;t try to optimize everything simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Pattern: Operations Suggest Adjacent Operations</h3>
<p>Success with one operation often reveals related ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentinel surveillance works → Try network effects, hub identification</li>
<li>Want list works → Try dealer networks, auction dynamics</li>
<li>Mycelial sharing works → Try resource gradient sensing, network pruning</li>
</ul>
<p>Let working operations pull in their neighbors.</p>
<h3>Pattern: Breakdowns Reveal Hidden Constraints</h3>
<p>When an operation doesn&#39;t quite fit, the friction reveals constraints you missed.</p>
<p>&quot;Stepping stones assumes fixed patches, but my safe spaces are temporally unstable&quot; → Reveals temporal dynamics constraint you hadn&#39;t modeled.</p>
<p>Breakdowns are information, not failures.</p>
<h3>Pattern: Reterritorialization Is Fine</h3>
<p>Not every line of flight needs to stay deterritorialized. Sometimes you find a new stratum that actually works. A stable job, a solid friend group, a neighborhood that fits.</p>
<p>The goal isn&#39;t permanent deterritorialization. It&#39;s having the capacity to follow lines of flight when strata aren&#39;t working.</p>
<h3>Pattern: Domain Mixing Signals Novelty</h3>
<p>If your assemblage composes 4+ unrelated domains, you&#39;re probably generating novel approaches.</p>
<p>Homogeneous composition (all operations from one domain) suggests staying within conventional territory. That&#39;s fine when it works.</p>
<h2>Extended Example: Fresh Start, Month by Month</h2>
<p><strong>Month 1: Opening Lines</strong></p>
<p>Territory line: Found temporary housing, started sentinel surveillance on neighborhoods
Connection line: CQ calls across three contexts, want list to five people
Becoming line: Nurse log inventory (what from past is substrate?)</p>
<p>Concrete outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of three candidate neighborhoods with visit schedule</li>
<li>Calendar of recurring events to attend</li>
<li>Specific criteria being broadcast: &quot;looking for collaborators on X&quot;</li>
<li>Three objects from old life intentionally placed in new space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 2: Selective Intensification</strong></p>
<p>What emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>One neighborhood clearly resonates (sentinel surveillance worked)</li>
<li>Philosophy group subgroup is high-signal (connection line intensifying)</li>
<li>Old identity patterns stronger than expected (becoming line needs more work)</li>
</ul>
<p>Revised assemblage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing search intensifies in one neighborhood (pioneer species: accept imperfect first option there)</li>
<li>Connection narrows to philosophy group + one other context (dormancy on third)</li>
<li>New operation: Controlled burns on old patterns (deliberately don&#39;t do things old-you would do)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Month 3: Structure Stabilizes and Transforms</strong></p>
<p>Territory: Found housing in target neighborhood. Territorial concern moves to background.
Connection: Three genuine connections forming. Network has seed structure.
Becoming: Clearer sense of new version. Some branches merged back, some still open.</p>
<p>New concerns emerging:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to deepen connections without premature crystallization</li>
<li>How to let professional identity evolve alongside personal</li>
<li>What the relationship is between new-city-you and old connections</li>
</ul>
<p>New operations being queried:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mycorrhizal resource sharing</strong>: How to contribute to network, not just extract</li>
<li><strong>Succession dynamics</strong>: What comes after pioneer phase</li>
<li><strong>Grafting</strong> (horticulture): How to connect different branches of identity</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem has transformed. You&#39;re no longer &quot;starting fresh&quot;—you&#39;re in the next phase. The composer continues.</p>
<h2>Relationship to Other Approaches</h2>
<p><strong>vs. Self-help / Life coaching:</strong>
Self-help stays within its stratum. &quot;Network more.&quot; &quot;Put yourself out there.&quot; Flight lines pull operations from mycology and ham radio and epidemiology.</p>
<p><strong>vs. Analogical reasoning:</strong>
Analogies map concepts. &quot;My social life is like a garden.&quot; Flight lines execute operations. &quot;Apply succession dynamics: pioneer species first, then guilds.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>vs. Design thinking:</strong>
Design thinking iterates within problem domain. Flight lines compose across domains based on structural fit.</p>
<p><strong>vs. Systems thinking:</strong>
Systems thinking analyzes dynamics within a frame. Flight lines escape frames entirely.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
<p>Operations exist beneath domain-strata as deterritorialized capacities. When problems resist stratified solutions, you can follow lines of flight by composing operations based on structural fit rather than semantic coherence.</p>
<p>The composer maintains parallel lines, intensifying some and letting others dissipate, constantly revising as execution produces new structure. It&#39;s not a planning method—it&#39;s a way of navigating.</p>
<p>Domain boundaries are real but not fundamental. Operations transcend them. Compose boldly, revise constantly, trust what produces concrete outputs.</p>
