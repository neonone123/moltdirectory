                  <h1>Closing Deals</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Closing is not a moment — it&#39;s the result of everything that came before it. If you did discovery well, wrote a sharp proposal, and handled objections honestly, closing feels natural, almost obvious. This playbook covers what to do at the finish line: how to move a warm prospect to a signed contract, how to recover deals that stall, and how to set up the relationship so the first day as a client is as smooth as possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: Recognize the Buying Signals</h2>
<p>Before you close, you need to know they&#39;re ready. Pushing a close on someone who isn&#39;t there yet damages trust. Watch for these signals:</p>
<p><strong>Strong buying signals (they&#39;re likely ready):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They ask about timelines, start dates, or onboarding details</li>
<li>They ask about contract or payment terms (logistics = intent)</li>
<li>They say things like &quot;when can we get started?&quot; or &quot;this looks great&quot;</li>
<li>They&#39;ve stopped asking objection-type questions and are asking implementation questions</li>
<li>They&#39;ve looped in another person (a finance person, a manager) — they&#39;re building internal consensus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weak or absent signals (they&#39;re not ready yet):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They go quiet for days after receiving the proposal</li>
<li>They keep asking about features or details but never move toward a decision</li>
<li>They say &quot;let me think about it&quot; with no specific timeline</li>
<li>They haven&#39;t responded to follow-ups</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> If you see strong signals, close. If you see weak or absent signals, don&#39;t push the close — address the underlying hesitation first.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 2: The Close — Techniques and Scripts</h2>
<p>Closing does not have to be high-pressure. For solopreneurs, the most effective closes are calm, confident, and make the next step obvious.</p>
<h3>Technique 1: The Assumptive Close</h3>
<p>Act as if the deal is happening. State the next step as if it&#39;s already agreed upon.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Great — I&#39;ll get the contract drafted with the terms we discussed and 
send it over this afternoon. Sound good?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This works because it removes the awkward &quot;so... do you want to do this?&quot; moment. If they have a problem with the assumption, they&#39;ll say so — and that&#39;s useful information.</p>
<h3>Technique 2: The Summary Close</h3>
<p>Recap everything you&#39;ve agreed on, then name the action to finalize.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;To recap — we&#39;re moving forward with [scope], starting [date], at 
$[price] with [payment terms]. I&#39;ll send the contract and first invoice 
today. Anything you&#39;d like to adjust before I do?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Summaries build momentum. Hearing the terms restated — especially after a negotiation — creates a sense of forward motion.</p>
<h3>Technique 3: The Urgency Close (Use Honestly)</h3>
<p>If there&#39;s a legitimate reason to act soon, state it. Do NOT manufacture fake urgency — solopreneurs live and die by trust.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;I want to flag — I have another project starting [date] that would 
affect my availability. If we kick off before then, I can give this 
my full focus. Otherwise, I&#39;d need to push the start date to [later date].&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Only use this if it&#39;s true. Fake deadlines destroy credibility.</p>
<h3>Technique 4: The Trial Close</h3>
<p>Test the waters before going for the full close. Lower the commitment, lower the resistance.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Would it make sense to start with Phase 1 this week? That way you can 
see results before committing to the full engagement.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>A phased start reduces the perceived risk. Many prospects who hesitate on a large commitment will say yes to a smaller first step — and then naturally continue.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 3: Handle the &quot;Let Me Think About It&quot; Stall</h2>
<p>This is the most common deal-killer for solopreneurs. &quot;Let me think about it&quot; usually means one of three things. Diagnose which one before responding.</p>
<h3>It means: &quot;I have a concern I haven&#39;t voiced.&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>How to tell:</strong> They were engaged until a specific point, then pulled back. Or they avoid committing but haven&#39;t said no.
<strong>Response:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Of course — I totally understand wanting to think it through. 
Before you do, is there anything specific that&#39;s giving you pause? 
I&#39;d rather address it now than have it sit in the back of your mind.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Surface the real objection. Address it directly. Often, once it&#39;s named, it dissolves.</p>
<h3>It means: &quot;The price feels high and I&#39;m looking for permission to spend it.&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>How to tell:</strong> They liked everything about the proposal but hesitated specifically around price or payment.
<strong>Response:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Totally fair. One thing that might help — [Company X] in a similar 
situation saw [specific result] within [timeframe]. The $[price] paid 
for itself in [X weeks/months]. Does that help frame it?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Return to the ROI. Help them justify the spend internally — to themselves or to whoever they report to.</p>
<h3>It means: &quot;I need to compare other options.&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>How to tell:</strong> They mentioned other vendors, or they haven&#39;t been responsive since the proposal.
<strong>Response:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Smart to compare — I&#39;d encourage that. If it helps, I&#39;m happy to 
answer any specific questions that come up as you evaluate. And if 
you&#39;d like, I can put together a quick comparison of what to look 
for in [this type of solution] so you&#39;re comparing apples to apples.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Don&#39;t badmouth competitors. Position yourself as the helpful advisor. Offering a &quot;what to look for&quot; guide keeps you in the conversation and subtly steers evaluation criteria toward your strengths.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 4: Recover a Stalled Deal</h2>
<p>Sometimes a deal goes cold — no response for a week or more. Here&#39;s how to bring it back without being annoying.</p>
<p><strong>Message 1 (Day 3-5 after last contact):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Hey [Name] — wanted to check in on [project/proposal]. Happy to 
answer any questions or jump on a quick call if that would help move 
things forward.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Simple. No pressure. Just a door left open.</p>
<p><strong>Message 2 (Day 7-10, different channel if possible):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;One thought since we last spoke — [a new insight, a relevant case 
study, or a small piece of value]. Thought it might be useful as you 
think through this.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Lead with value, not a nudge. This re-engages the conversation on your terms.</p>
<p><strong>Message 3 (Day 14+, the breakup message):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Wanted to close the loop on this. I understand timing isn&#39;t always 
right, and that&#39;s completely fine. If things change down the road, 
I&#39;d love to pick this up again. Best of luck either way.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;breakup message&quot; paradoxically has the highest response rate of the three. Giving them permission to walk away often makes them want to stay. If they don&#39;t respond, let it go — but leave the door open.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 5: Contract to Payment — The Handoff</h2>
<p>Once they say yes, move fast and make it frictionless. Slow or confusing handoffs lose deals that are already won.</p>
<p><strong>Checklist for the 24-48 hours after close:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Send the contract (use a signing tool: HelloSign, DocuSign, or even a simple PDF with e-signature). Include only what&#39;s necessary — scope, price, terms, start date, payment. Don&#39;t make them read a 20-page legal document.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Send the first invoice (if upfront payment is required). Include clear payment instructions and a deadline.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Send a warm welcome message: express genuine enthusiasm, restate what happens next, and set expectations for the first week.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Calendar the kickoff. Even if it&#39;s a self-serve product, a brief kickoff call or onboarding email sets the tone for the relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speed matters here.</strong> Every hour between &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;signed contract&quot; is an hour where doubt can creep in. Make it easy and fast to formalize.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 6: Set Up for Retention and Expansion</h2>
<p>The deal isn&#39;t really &quot;closed&quot; until they&#39;ve experienced value. Everything between signing and first value delivery is the danger zone for early churn.</p>
<p><strong>First 7 days post-close:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver a quick win — something small that shows immediate results. This builds confidence that the larger promise will be kept.</li>
<li>Over-communicate. Send a progress update even if there&#39;s nothing new to say. Silence feels like neglect to a new client.</li>
<li>Ask one question: &quot;Is there anything you need from me to make this work smoothly on your end?&quot; This makes them feel like a partner, not just a customer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>First 30 days post-close:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check in once (not five times). Ask how things are going. Listen more than you talk.</li>
<li>Identify the first natural upsell or expansion opportunity — but don&#39;t pitch it yet. Plant the seed: &quot;Once we&#39;ve nailed [Phase 1], there&#39;s a natural next step that could [outcome]. We can talk about that whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Closing Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Closing too early. If they&#39;re not ready, pushing the close creates resistance. Read the signals first.</li>
<li>Closing too late. If they ARE ready and you keep having &quot;just one more&quot; conversations, you&#39;re burning their momentum and giving doubt time to grow.</li>
<li>Apologizing for your price during the close. Confidence is contagious. If you believe in your price, they will too.</li>
<li>Making the contract complicated. A simple, clear contract closes faster than a thorough but dense one. Cover the essentials; save the edge cases for if and when they matter.</li>
<li>Disappearing after the signature. The close is the beginning of the relationship, not the end of the sales process. Treat it that way.</li>
</ul>
