</ul>
<h3>Employee Personal Brand:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Manager approval required</li>
<li>Must align with company messaging</li>
<li>Limited topics and positioning</li>
<li>Need portable brand strategy  </li>
<li>Lower risk, constrained upside</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Framework Application:</strong></p>

<h3><strong>FINTECH FOUNDER ARCHETYPES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Archetype 1: &quot;The Regulatory Navigator&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>POSITIONING STATEMENT:
&quot;I help fintech founders navigate Indian/US financial regulations.
RBI/SEC compliance made understandable.&quot;

PROFILE:
Voice: Educational, factual, conservative
Risk tolerance: ZERO (regulatory = zero tolerance)
Legal requirement: EVERY post reviewed (1-3 days)
Differentiation: Regulatory expertise
Competitive edge: You&#39;ve navigated licensing successfully

MANDATORY FOR ALL FINTECH:
🔴 Legal review EVERY post (no exceptions)
🔴 Disclaimer on EVERY post
🔴 NEVER share user financial data (even anonymized)
🔴 NEVER attack competitors (regulatory scrutiny)
🔴 NEVER unverified claims (must prove everything)

COST OF COMPLIANCE:
- Legal retainer: $5K-10K/month
- Review time: 1-3 days per post
- Posting frequency: 2×/week maximum
- Worth it: Avoiding ₹1Cr+ fines, license revocation

CONTENT STRATEGY (2 posts/week):

Tuesday: Regulatory update
Template:
&quot;RBI updated [regulation]. Here&#39;s what changed.&quot;

Example:
&quot;RBI Updated Payment Aggregator Guidelines (Jan 2026)

What Changed:
1. Net worth requirement: ₹25 Cr (was ₹15 Cr)
2. Escrow account mandatory (new requirement)
3. Monthly reporting to RBI (was quarterly)

What This Means for Fintech Founders:
- If you&#39;re payment aggregator: Need ₹10 Cr more capital
- Timeline: 12 months to comply
- If you can&#39;t: Apply for exemption or shut down

Our Journey:
We went through PA licensing in 2024.
Timeline: 18 months from application to approval.
Cost: ₹50 lakhs (legal + compliance)

Lessons:
1. Start 24 months before you need license
2. Budget 2× what you think for legal
3. Hire ex-RBI consultant (worth it)

Disclaimer: This is educational content, not legal advice.
Consult qualified legal counsel for your specific situation.

Source: RBI Circular RBI/2026/23 [link to official RBI document]&quot;

Why this works:
✅ Timely (just announced)
✅ Specific (exact numbers, dates)
✅ Helpful (what to do next)
✅ Personal (you did this)
✅ Compliant (disclaimer, official sources)

Legal review checklist:
□ Facts accurate? (verified against RBI source)
□ Disclaimer included?
□ No user data shared?
□ No unverified claims?
□ Official source cited?

Thursday: Educational best practice
Template:
&quot;KYC requirements for fintechs: Complete checklist&quot;

Example:
&quot;KYC Requirements for Indian Fintechs (2026 Update)

Mandatory Documents:
□ PAN card (all customers)
□ Aadhaar (for e-KYC via UIDAI)
□ Address proof (if Aadhaar address &gt;3 months old)
□ Photograph (recent, clear)

E-KYC via Aadhaar:
- Allowed for: Bank accounts, wallets, small loans
- NOT allowed for: Large loans (&gt;₹50K), investment accounts
- Process: OTP authentication + biometric
- Cost: ₹5-10 per verification

Video KYC:
- RBI approved since 2020
- Requirements:
  * Live video call
  * PAN + Aadhaar verification
  * Geo-tagging
  * Recording stored 10 years
- Cost: ₹50-100 per verification

Ongoing Monitoring:
- Re-KYC every 10 years (low-risk)
- Re-KYC every 2 years (high-risk)
- Transaction monitoring (suspicious activity)
- PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) screening

How We Do It:
- Primary: Aadhaar e-KYC (₹5/verification)
- Fallback: Video KYC if Aadhaar fails
- Ongoing: Monthly PEP screening

Cost: ₹8/customer (average)
Timeline: 2-5 minutes per customer

Disclaimer: This is educational content, not legal/compliance advice.
Regulations change frequently. Verify with CASA-certified consultant.

- RBI Master Direction on KYC [link]
- PMLA Rules 2002 (amended 2023) [link]&quot;

POSTING FREQUENCY: 2×/week MAXIMUM
Why: Legal review bottleneck (1-3 days per post)

TIME INVESTMENT:
- Content creation: 2 hours
- Legal review: 1-3 days wait time
- Revisions: 1 hour
- Total: 3-4 hours per post, plus wait time

METRICS TO TRACK:
- Fellow fintech founders following (your niche)
- Consultation requests (high-quality leads)
- Media mentions (need expert for fintech stories)

EVOLUTION PATH:
Series A: Build credibility (educate community)
Series B: Thought leadership (speak at fintech events)
Series C+: Category expert (regulators know you)

FIRST 90 DAYS:
Week 1-12: 24 posts (2×/week)
- 12 regulatory updates
- 12 compliance guides
Result: Known as &quot;go-to expert&quot; on compliance

<p><strong>Archetype 2: &quot;The Financial Inclusion Champion&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>POSITIONING STATEMENT:
&quot;Bringing financial services to unbanked Bharat.
200M Indians deserve access.&quot;

PROFILE:
Voice: Mission-driven, inspiring, inclusive
Risk tolerance: LOW-MEDIUM
Legal requirement: Still legal review, but more flexible
Differentiation: Social mission
Competitive edge: Impact stories

CONTENT STRATEGY (2 posts/week):

Tuesday: Mission/impact story
Template:
&quot;Why [underserved segment] needs better fintech&quot;

Example:
&quot;200 million Indians are still unbanked.

Not because they don&#39;t want banking.
Because banks don&#39;t want them.

The reality:
- Rural India: Nearest bank branch 15 km away
- Daily wage workers: Can&#39;t take day off to open account
- Small merchants: Banks won&#39;t give them PoS terminals

Traditional banks optimize for:
- High-value customers (metros)
- Large transactions (not ₹100 UPI)
- Salaried employees (not daily wage)

But the unbanked aren&#39;t a charity case.
They&#39;re a market.

The math:
- 200M unbanked
- Spend ₹10K/month average
- Total addressable: ₹2T/year
- Currently cash-only (inefficient)

What fintech can do:
1. Mobile-first banking
   - No branch visit needed
   - Aadhaar e-KYC in 2 minutes
   - Zero balance account

2. Micro-lending
   - ₹500-5,000 loans
   - 7-day terms
   - Repayment via UPI

3. Digital payments
   - QR code PoS (free)
   - UPI acceptance
   - No MDR charges

We&#39;re building for:
The kirana shop owner in Tier 3 city
The farmer who needs crop insurance
The daily wage worker who wants to save ₹50/day

Not charity. Business.
Because financial inclusion is good business.

If you&#39;re building for Bharat (not just India), let&#39;s connect.&quot;

Why this works:
✅ Mission-driven (social impact)
✅ Business case (not just charity)
✅ Specific market (200M unbanked)
✅ Concrete solutions (what fintech can do)
✅ Still compliant (no financial advice)

Thursday: Product/feature story
Template:
&quot;How we made [feature] accessible for [segment]&quot;

Example:
&quot;How we made digital payments accessible for Tier 3 kirana shops:

The Problem:
- Kirana shops: 12 million in India
- 70% don&#39;t accept digital payments
- Why? PoS terminals cost ₹3,000-5,000
- Merchants can&#39;t afford it

What we built:
- QR code-based payments (free)
- Works with any UPI app
- No hardware needed
- Merchant gets SMS confirmations

Features for low-tech users:
1. Voice SMS confirmations
   - Payment received: Automated call in local language
   - &quot;Aapko ₹150 mile, Customer: Rahul&quot;

2. Daily settlement SMS
   - Every evening: Total day&#39;s collections
   - &quot;Aaj ₹2,450 mile. Kal subah account mein aayega&quot;

3. Vernacular support
   - Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati
   - Local language = trust

Results:
- 50,000 kirana shops onboarded
- 85% still active after 90 days (retention)
- Average ₹15K/month digital collections
- Merchant feedback: &quot;Pehle barabari mehsus karti hai&quot; (Finally feel equal)

The Impact:
Not just payments.
Financial inclusion.
Dignity.

<h3><strong>OPERATIONS TECH FOUNDER ARCHETYPES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Archetype 1: &quot;The India Retail Execution Expert&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>POSITIONING STATEMENT:
&quot;I&#39;ve spent 15 years in CPG distribution in India.
Now helping brands execute in kiranas, mom-and-pop stores.&quot;

PROFILE:
Voice: Practical, field-tested, India-specific
Risk tolerance: MEDIUM
Audience: Niche (CPG brands, FMCG, distribution)
Differentiation: Deep India retail expertise
Competitive edge: You&#39;ve been in the field

CONTENT STRATEGY (3 posts/week):

Monday: India retail reality
Template:
&quot;The truth about [India retail challenge]&quot;

Example:
&quot;The truth about kirana distribution in India:

Everyone thinks: Modern trade is the future
Reality: Kiranas = 90% of retail sales

The Numbers:
- 12 million kirana stores in India
- 8 million in Tier 2/3/4 cities
- 70% of FMCG sales
- NOT going away

Why Kiranas Survive:
1. Location (within 200m of every home)
2. Credit (allow monthly billing for regular customers)
3. Relationships (shopkeeper knows your family)
4. Hours (open 6 AM to 11 PM daily)

Modern trade can&#39;t compete on these.

Distribution Challenges:
- 8 million stores across 28 states
- No addresses (literally: &quot;Blue shop near temple&quot;)
- Cash-only (85% of stores)
- Low order values (₹500-2,000 per order)
- High frequency (daily/weekly restocking)

How CPG brands do it:
1. Distributor network
   - 5,000-10,000 distributors nationwide
   - Each covers 500-1,000 stores
   - Manual order taking (sales rep visits)

2. Field force management
   - 50,000-100,000 field reps
   - Paper-based or basic mobile apps
   - Attendance tracking nightmare

3. Merchandising
   - Manual shelf checks
   - Planogram compliance &lt;30%
   - Stock-outs common

We&#39;re digitizing this:
- Route optimization (field force efficiency +40%)
- Digital ordering (order accuracy +60%)
- Inventory visibility (stock-outs -35%)

But it&#39;s hard. Really hard.
Because you&#39;re not just building software.
You&#39;re changing 50-year-old distribution networks.

If you&#39;re building for India retail, DM me.
I&#39;ve made every mistake already.&quot;

Tuesday: Field force best practices
Template:
&quot;How to manage [X] field reps in India&quot;

Example:
&quot;Managing 10,000 field reps across India: Lessons learned

The Challenge:
- 10,000 reps (our client&#39;s)
- 28 states, 500+ cities
- Selling FMCG to kiranas
- Attendance fraud: 30% (reps don&#39;t actually visit stores)

What Doesn&#39;t Work:
❌ GPS tracking only (easy to game: sit outside store, mark attendance)
❌ Photo proof only (take photo, don&#39;t actually sell)
❌ Honor system (30% fraud)

What Works:
✅ Geo-fenced check-in + store receipt photo
  - Must be within 50m of store
  - Must show today&#39;s date on receipt
  - Must show products sold

✅ Random audits (10% of stores/month)
  - Manager calls store: &quot;Did rep visit?&quot;
  - Fraud drops to &lt;5% with random audits

✅ Performance-based incentives
  - Base salary: ₹15K/month
  - Variable: ₹5-20K (based on sales, not just visits)
  - High performers earn 2× base

The Tech Stack:
- Mobile app (Android, &lt;10MB, works on ₹5K phones)
- Offline-first (data syncs when internet available)
- Battery-efficient (field reps can&#39;t charge all day)
- Vernacular (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi)

Results:
- Attendance fraud: 5% (was 30%)
- Sales per rep: +45%
- Rep satisfaction: Higher (fair incentives)

Key Insight:
You can&#39;t just build software for India retail.
You need to understand:
- Ground realities (power cuts, no internet)
- Human behavior (fraud, shortcuts)
- Local context (relationships matter)

Tech is 30% of solution.
Understanding India is 70%.&quot;

Friday: CPG go-to-market insights
Template:
&quot;How [brand type] should approach India distribution&quot;

Example:
&quot;D2C brands entering kirana distribution: Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts

The Dream:
&quot;We&#39;ll bypass distributors and go direct to kiranas!&quot;

The Reality:
You&#39;ll fail in 6 months. Here&#39;s why.

Why Distributors Exist:
1. Credit (they float 30-60 day terms)
   - Kiranas can&#39;t pay upfront
   - You don&#39;t want to float ₹10 Cr working capital

2. Logistics (they handle last-mile)
   - 8 million stores = impossible to reach direct
   - Distributor has 50 trucks, 200 delivery boys

3. Relationships (they&#39;ve been doing this 20 years)
   - Kirana trusts distributor
   - Won&#39;t trust random D2C brand

What D2C Should Do:
1. Partner with distributors (don&#39;t fight them)
   - Offer better margins than FMCG (25% vs 10%)
   - Provide marketing support (posters, samples)
   - Make it easy for them to sell you

2. Start in metros (test product-market fit)
   - Modern trade first (easier to get distribution)
   - Amazon/Flipkart/BigBasket
   - Then kiranas (once you have demand)

3. Tier 2/3 expansion (after metro success)
   - Distributors will come to YOU
   - Because kiranas are asking for your product
   - Pull strategy &gt; Push strategy

What Usually Happens:
- Month 1: &quot;We&#39;ll disrupt distribution!&quot;
- Month 6: &quot;Distributors actually know what they&#39;re doing&quot;
- Month 12: Partner with distributors
- Month 24: Actually scaling

Save yourself 18 months.
Work with distributors from day 1.

Trust me. I tried the hard way.&quot;

What You Want:
✅ Build personal brand (future career security)

✅ Have portable brand if you leave
✅ Attract opportunities (jobs, consulting, speaking)

What Your Company Wants:
⚠️ You promote company brand (not personal)

⚠️ You don&#39;t recruit colleagues to competitors
⚠️ Your brand stays professional (reflects on company)

THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION:
&quot;Can I build personal brand without getting fired?&quot;

ANSWER: Yes, but with guardrails.

<pre><code>STEP 1: What&#39;s Your Role?

VP/Director at Series A/B Startup:
→ GREEN LIGHT (proceed to strategy)

Manager/IC at Series A/B:
→ YELLOW LIGHT (get manager permission first)

Any role at Public Company:
→ YELLOW LIGHT (check social media policy)

Any role in Fintech/Healthcare:
→ RED LIGHT (legal review required)

Employee at Series C+ with Corp Comms:
→ RED LIGHT (limited personal branding)

STEP 2: What&#39;s Your Manager&#39;s Stance?

Manager says: &quot;Yes! Build your brand!&quot;
→ GREEN LIGHT

Manager says: &quot;Sure, just don&#39;t share confidential stuff&quot;
→ YELLOW LIGHT (get clearer boundaries)

Manager says: &quot;All comms go through Corp Comms&quot;
→ RED LIGHT (very limited)

Manager says nothing (you haven&#39;t asked):
→ STOP. Ask first. (see Section B3)

STEP 3: What&#39;s Your Company&#39;s Policy?

Written social media policy exists:
→ Read it carefully, follow it

No written policy:
→ Get explicit permission (see Section B3)

Policy says &quot;all comms through Corp Comms&quot;:
→ RED LIGHT (build internally only)

DECISION OUTCOMES:

GREEN LIGHT = Build Personal Brand
- Post 3-5×/week
- 70% industry, 30% company
- Manager supportive
→ GO TO: Employee Content Strategy (B4)

YELLOW LIGHT = Build Carefully
- Post 2-3×/week
- 80% industry, 20% company
- Get approval for company content
→ GO TO: Approval Workflows (B5)

RED LIGHT = Very Limited or Wait
- Internal content only (company blog)
- Or wait until you leave
- Focus on building skills, not brand
→ GO TO: Internal Brand Building (B6)
</code></pre>
<h2>B3: The &quot;Get Permission First&quot; Conversation</h2>
<pre><code>THE SCRIPT (With Your Manager):

&quot;Hey [Manager name], I&#39;d like to talk about building my personal brand on LinkedIn.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking:
- Post industry insights (not company-specific)
- Share frameworks I&#39;ve learned
- Maybe occasionally share company wins (with approval)

This could help with:
- Recruiting (people see us as thought leaders)
- Our brand (extends our reach)
- My professional development

What are the boundaries?
- What can I share about our company?
- What requires your approval first?
- Are there topics I should avoid?&quot;

GOOD MANAGER RESPONSES:

&quot;Great idea! Here are the rules:
- Don&#39;t share revenue, customer names, or roadmap
- Run company metrics by me first
- Otherwise, go for it&quot;
→ This is GREEN LIGHT

&quot;I like it. Let&#39;s set up monthly check-ins to review your posts.&quot;
→ This is YELLOW LIGHT (careful but supportive)

NEUTRAL MANAGER RESPONSES:

&quot;I guess that&#39;s fine? Just don&#39;t share anything confidential.&quot;
→ YELLOW LIGHT (push for more clarity: &quot;Can you define confidential?&quot;)

&quot;Let me check with Corp Comms and get back to you.&quot;
→ YELLOW LIGHT (they&#39;re being cautious, which is fair)

BAD MANAGER RESPONSES:

&quot;Not comfortable. All external comms go through Corp Comms.&quot;
→ RED LIGHT (don&#39;t fight it, build internally)

&quot;Why do you need a personal brand? Focus on your job.&quot;
→ RED LIGHT (they see this as threat, tread carefully)

WHAT TO DO WITH EACH:

GREEN LIGHT:
✅ Start building immediately
✅ Monthly check-ins with manager
✅ Self-police boundaries

YELLOW LIGHT:
⚠️ Get WRITTEN guidelines (email summary of conversation)
⚠️ Start slow (1-2 posts/week, gauge reaction)
⚠️ Over-communicate (share drafts proactively)

RED LIGHT:
🔴 Don&#39;t fight it (you&#39;ll lose)
🔴 Build internally (company blog, Slack, all-hands)
🔴 Plan to build externally AFTER you leave
</code></pre>
<h2>B4: Employee Content Strategy (70/20/10 Rule)</h2>
<pre><code>THE MAGIC FORMULA:

70% Industry Insights (Portable)
- Trends, research, best practices
- Tool reviews, comparisons
- Conference learnings
- NOT company-specific
→ This builds YOUR brand (goes with you when you leave)

20% Frameworks (Helpful)
- &quot;My [X] template&quot;
- &quot;How I think about [Y]&quot;
- General methodologies
- NOT proprietary company IP
→ This builds credibility

10% Company (With Approval)
- Announcements (hiring, funding)
- Customer wins (with permission)
- Team culture
→ This supports company

WHY 70/20/10:

You WILL leave eventually:
- Average tenure: 2-3 years
- If 90% of your content is company-specific
- You leave with NO personal brand
- All that work benefits company, not you

Your brand should be PORTABLE:
- Industry insights = valuable anywhere
- Company content = only valuable while you&#39;re there
- Build for: Your next role, not just current role

EXAMPLES BY CONTENT TYPE:

✅ 70% Industry Insights (GOOD):

&quot;The state of product-led growth in 2026:

I analyzed 50 PLG companies&#39; public metrics.
Here&#39;s what&#39;s working:

1. Free trial → Freemium shift
   - 60% of PLG companies now offer freemium
   - Why: Higher activation, more word-of-mouth

2. Time-to-value acceleration
   - Top PLG: &lt;5 minutes to &quot;aha moment&quot;
   - Average: 30-60 minutes
   - Gap = churn predictor

3. In-product education
   - Interactive guides &gt; video tutorials
   - Contextual help &gt; help center
   - 40% higher activation

Key takeaway:
PLG is table stakes now.
Competitive advantage = speed to value.

Sources: [public company metrics, SaaS industry reports]&quot;

Why this is PORTABLE:
→ Industry insights (not company-specific)
→ Valuable to any PLG company
→ Shows expertise (helpful to community)
→ If you leave, this content still relevant

✅ 20% Frameworks (GOOD):

&quot;The content calendar template I use:

Most teams over-complicate content calendars.
Here&#39;s my simple template:

MONDAY:
- Theme: Product education
- Format: Tutorial (how-to)
- Length: 500-700 words
- Goal: Activation

WEDNESDAY:
- Theme: Customer success
- Format: Case study
- Length: 800-1,000 words
- Goal: Social proof

FRIDAY:
- Theme: Thought leadership
- Format: Industry analysis
- Length: 1,200-1,500 words
- Goal: SEO + brand

Why this works:
- Focused themes (not random)
- Consistent format (predictable)
- Clear goals (measurable)

Template: [link to Google Sheets template]

Feel free to copy and adapt.&quot;

Why this is PORTABLE:
→ General framework (not company IP)
→ Helpful to community
→ Shows your thinking
→ Works at any company

✅ 10% Company (GOOD - with approval):

&quot;Excited to share: We just hit 1,000 customers! 🎉

18 months ago, we were 3 people and an idea.
Today: 50 employees, 1,000 customers, $10M ARR.

Couldn&#39;t have done it without this incredible team.

If you&#39;re a product marketer looking for Series B startup:
We&#39;re hiring! [Link to careers page]&quot;

Why this is OK:
→ Company milestone (public info)
→ Celebrating team (not bragging)
→ Recruiting (helps company)
→ NOT sharing strategy or confidential metrics

❌ BAD (Company-specific, gives away too much):

&quot;Our product roadmap for Q1:
- [Unannounced feature A]
- [Unannounced feature B]
- [Competitive positioning against X]

We&#39;re going to destroy [Competitor] in this category.&quot;

Why this is BAD:
→ Product roadmap (confidential)
→ Competitive intel (helps competitors)
→ Aggressive tone (reflects poorly on company)
→ Could get you fired

CONTENT MIX TRACKER:

Week 1:
- Mon: Industry insight (70%)
- Wed: Framework (20%)
- Fri: Company update (10%)

Week 2:
- Mon: Industry insight (70%)
- Wed: Industry insight (70%)
- Fri: Framework (20%)

Running average: 70% portable, 20% helpful, 10% company
→ This is the goal

<h2>B5: Employee Approval Workflows</h2>
<pre><code>APPROVAL WORKFLOWS BY ROLE &amp; COMPANY:

SERIES A EMPLOYEE (50-150 people):

Standard Post (Industry Insight):
Draft → Publish (same day)
No approval needed

Company Metrics/Wins:
Draft → Manager Slack → Approval → Publish (few hours)

Example workflow:
You: &quot;Hey [Manager], planning to post about our Series A raise.
Draft: [paste draft]
OK to share?&quot;
Manager (2 hours later): &quot;Yes, looks good!&quot;
You: Publish

Timeline: Hours, not days

SERIES B EMPLOYEE (150-500 people):

Standard Post:
Draft → Publish (same day)
Unless: Company metrics, customer names, strategy

Company Content:
Draft → Manager → Corp Comms (if exists) → Publish (1-2 days)

Example workflow:
Day 1 (Mon): Draft post about customer win
Day 1 (Mon afternoon): Send to manager for review
Day 2 (Tue morning): Manager approves, forwards to Corp Comms
Day 2 (Tue afternoon): Corp Comms minor edits (&quot;remove specific ARR number&quot;)
Day 2 (Tue evening): You revise, get final OK, publish

Timeline: 1-2 days

SERIES C+ EMPLOYEE (500+ people):

Most Posts:
Draft → Manager → Corp Comms → Legal (if financial) → Publish (1-2 weeks)

Example workflow:
Week 1 (Mon): Draft post
Week 1 (Tue): Manager review
Week 1 (Wed): Corp Comms review (&quot;can you tone down this part?&quot;)
Week 1 (Thu): You revise
Week 1 (Fri): Legal review (if mentions any numbers)
Week 2 (Mon): Final approval
Week 2 (Tue): Publish

Timeline: 1-2 weeks (expect this at large companies)

Only Safe Posts (No Approval):
- Pure industry insights
- Personal career reflections
- Sharing other people&#39;s content
→ These you can post immediately

PUBLIC COMPANY EMPLOYEE:

Assume: EVERYTHING needs approval

Standard workflow:
Draft → Manager → Corp Comms → Legal → IR (Investor Relations) → CEO (maybe) → Publish (2-4 weeks)

Reality:
Most employees at public companies just don&#39;t build public personal brands.
Too much friction.

Instead:
- Internal blog posts (company website)
- Company LinkedIn (post as company, not you)
- Wait until you leave company

FINTECH EMPLOYEE (Any stage):

Assume: Legal review EVERY post

Even generic posts about fintech:
Draft → Manager → Legal → Publish (3-5 days)

Why: Regulatory risk
One wrong claim = company fines

Most fintech employees:
Don&#39;t build public personal brands while employed.
Wait until they leave.

APPROVAL TRACKING TEMPLATE:

Post: [Title]
Draft date: [Date]
Submitted to: [Manager name]
Status: [Pending / Approved / Needs revision]
Expected publish: [Date]
Actual publish: [Date]

Keep a log. You&#39;ll need it to:
- Track how long approvals take
- Show manager bottleneck (if &gt;1 week average)
- Decide if worth continuing
</code></pre>
<h2>B6: Building Internal Brand (Alternative Strategy)</h2>
<pre><code>IF: You can&#39;t build public personal brand (RED LIGHT situation)

THEN: Build internal brand instead

INTERNAL BRAND TACTICS:

1. Company Blog (High Impact)
- Write for company blog (not LinkedIn)
- Still bylined under your name
- Still builds your expertise
- Company controls distribution

Benefits:
✅ No approval friction (company owns it)
✅ SEO value (company domain)
✅ Still associated with your name
✅ Portfolio piece when you leave

2. Internal Thought Leadership
- Weekly email to team
- Monthly lunch &amp; learn presentations
- Quarterly all-hands talks
- Slack posts (company Slack)

Benefits:
✅ Builds internal reputation (helps promotions)
✅ Visibility to leadership
✅ Practice for public speaking
✅ Can reference in job interviews

3. Conference Speaking (Company-Sponsored)
- Apply to speak at conferences
- Company pays travel
- Present under company affiliation
- Slides reviewed by Corp Comms

Benefits:
✅ Public visibility (your name on conference site)
✅ Recording you can share later
✅ Networking (meet industry peers)
✅ Company approves (they sponsored it)

4. Guest Bylines (Company-Approved)
- Write for industry publications
- Company reviews before submission
- Byline: &quot;[Your Name], [Title] at [Company]&quot;
- One-time approval (vs ongoing LinkedIn)

Benefits:
✅ Higher prestige than LinkedIn
✅ Permanent (publication archives)
✅ SEO (your name ranks for topic)
✅ Company usually approves (free PR for them)

INTERNAL BRAND STRATEGY:

Year 1: Build internally
- Company blog monthly
- Lunch &amp; learns quarterly
- All-hands presentations (when invited)

Year 2: Selective external
- 1-2 conference talks per year
- 1-2 guest bylines per year
- Company-sponsored, reviewed

Year 3: Transition
- By now, you have portfolio
- Conference talks ✅
- Published articles ✅
- Known internally ✅

When you leave:
→ You have external-facing brand
→ Built with company&#39;s support
→ Now you can accelerate on LinkedIn

BETTER THAN: Fighting company for LinkedIn posts that get rejected

<h1>📊 SECTION C: FINTECH SPECIAL CASE (Extreme Caution Required)</h1>
<p>[Already covered in Fintech archetypes above - regulatory requirements, legal review, posting constraints]</p>
<hr>
<h1>📊 SECTION D: EXIT STRATEGY (Portable Brand)</h1>
<h2>D1: Planning to Leave (6-12 Month Playbook)</h2>
<pre><code>GOAL: Build brand that goes WITH you when you leave

THE PROBLEM:

Most employees:
- Build &quot;VP Marketing @Company&quot; brand
- All content about company
- Leave → No personal brand → Start from zero

Better approach:
- Build &quot;[Expertise] who works at Company&quot; brand
- 70% content about expertise
- Leave → Strong personal brand → Carry momentum

6-12 MONTH TRANSITION PLAN:

MONTH 1-3: FOUNDATION

Week 1-2: Audit current brand
□ LinkedIn headline: Does it lead with role or expertise?
  Bad: &quot;VP Marketing @Company&quot;
  Good: &quot;B2B SaaS Marketer | VP @Company&quot;

□ Content: What % is company-specific vs portable?
  Goal: 70% portable (industry insights)
  Reality for most: 90% company-specific

□ Audience: Who follows you?
  Company employees only? (not portable)
  Industry peers? (portable)

Week 3-4: Shift positioning
□ Update headline: Lead with expertise, not company
□ Update about section: Your expertise first, current role second
□ Start posting 70% industry insights (shift from company content)

Month 2-3: Build portable content
□ Weekly industry insights (not company-specific)
□ Frameworks you&#39;ve developed (generalizable)
□ Conference learnings
□ Book reviews, tool comparisons

Goal: If someone discovers you today, they see expertise (not just company)

MONTH 4-6: BUILD OWNED AUDIENCE

Start Email List (Critical):
□ Substack or ConvertKit
□ Weekly or bi-weekly newsletter
□ Topic: Your expertise (not company news)

Why this matters:
- LinkedIn followers = LinkedIn owns
- Email subscribers = YOU own
- When you leave, you take email list with you

Content:
□ Expand LinkedIn posts into newsletter essays
□ 1,000-1,500 words weekly
□ Build to 500-2,000 subscribers (before you leave)

This is YOUR audience. Not company&#39;s.

MONTH 7-9: ESTABLISH EXPERTISE

Conference Speaking:
□ Apply to 5-10 conferences
□ Topic: Your expertise (not company product pitch)
□ Goal: 2-3 speaking slots in next 6 months

Example:
Bad topic: &quot;How Company X does marketing&quot; (too company-specific)
Good topic: &quot;The future of PLG marketing&quot; (expertise-based)

Bylines:
□ Pitch 3-5 industry publications
□ Articles about your expertise
□ Bylined under your name

Podcasts:
□ Guest on 3-5 industry podcasts
□ Talk about expertise (not company)

MONTH 10-12: PREPARE TRANSITION

Audience Analysis:
□ LinkedIn followers: 3K-10K (portable)
□ Newsletter subscribers: 500-2K (owned)
□ Speaking: 2-3 conference talks (credibility)
□ Bylines: 2-3 published articles (SEO)

Positioning:
□ Known for: [Your expertise], not just &quot;[Company] employee&quot;
□ Can start consulting immediately after leaving
□ Network of people who know YOU (not just your company)

WHEN YOU GIVE NOTICE:

Day 1: Inform manager
Day 2-30: Transition work
Day 30 (Last day): 

Your LinkedIn:
- Already optimized for expertise (done months ago)
- Followers know you for expertise (not company)
- Email list is YOURS (take it with you)
- Speaking engagements booked (credibility)

Now:
- Change LinkedIn headline: Remove company
- Email subscribers: &quot;I&#39;ve left [Company], now doing [consulting/new role]&quot;
- Continue posting (no gap)

RESULT:
→ Smooth transition (not starting from zero)
→ Immediate opportunities (consulting, jobs)
→ Portable brand (built over 12 months)
</code></pre>
<h2>D2: Non-Compete Considerations</h2>
<pre><code>UNDERSTANDING NON-COMPETES:

Most Companies Have:
□ Non-compete (can&#39;t work for competitor for 6-12 months)
□ Non-solicit (can&#39;t recruit employees or customers)
□ IP agreement (company owns work created while employed)

NON-COMPETE MYTHS:

Myth: &quot;Non-competes aren&#39;t enforceable&quot;
Reality: Depends on state/country
- California: Generally not enforceable (except for sale of business)
- New York: Enforceable if reasonable (6-12 months, specific geography)
- India: Enforceable for senior employees (directors, C-suite)

Myth: &quot;I can just ignore it&quot;
Reality: Company CAN sue
- May not win, but legal battle costs ₹10-50 lakhs
- Risk: Injunction (court orders you to stop)
- Better: Understand and work around it

SAFE PERSONAL BRAND STRATEGIES (Even with non-compete):

1. Broad Expertise (Not Narrow Niche)
✅ SAFE: &quot;B2B SaaS Marketing&quot;
❌ VIOLATION: &quot;Conversation Intelligence Marketing&quot;

If you work for conversation intelligence company:
- Don&#39;t position as &quot;Conversation intelligence expert&quot;
- Position as &quot;B2B SaaS marketing expert&quot;
- When non-compete expires → narrow down

2. Educator/Consultant (Not Direct Competitor)
✅ SAFE: &quot;I help B2B companies with content strategy&quot; (consulting)
❌ VIOLATION: &quot;I do what my company does, freelance&quot; (direct competition)

Most non-competes:
- Prohibit working for COMPETITORS
- Don&#39;t prohibit CONSULTING (if you&#39;re not competing)
- Gray area: Ask lawyer

3. Different Industry
✅ SAFE: Work in Sales Tech → Build brand in HR Tech (different vertical)
❌ VIOLATION: Work in Sales Tech → Join competitor in Sales Tech

Example:
- You: VP Marketing @Gong (conversation intelligence)
- Non-compete: 12 months
- Strategy: Build brand in &quot;B2B SaaS marketing&quot; (broad)
- After 12 months: Join HR Tech company (different vertical) OR
- Narrow to &quot;conversation intelligence&quot; after non-compete expires

WHAT YOU CAN&#39;T DO (Clear Violations):

❌ Solicit customers
- Can&#39;t email customer list: &quot;I&#39;m at new company now, work with me&quot;
- This WILL get you sued
- Courts enforce this aggressively

❌ Recruit employees
- Can&#39;t mass email colleagues: &quot;Join me at new company&quot;
- This is theft of trade secrets (employee list)
- Criminal liability possible

❌ Use company IP
- Can&#39;t take: Customer lists, code, documents, presentations
- Can&#39;t recreate: Exact same product/process
- Gray area: General knowledge (what you learned)

WHAT YOU CAN DO (Generally Safe):

✅ Build personal brand on industry expertise
- Generic insights (not company secrets)
- Your expertise (what&#39;s in your head)
- Broad positioning (not company-specific)

✅ Networking
- Connect with industry peers (not soliciting)
- Attend conferences
- Build relationships

✅ Consulting (if genuinely different)
- Consult on different problems than your company solves
- Example: You work for CRM company → Consult on marketing strategy (not CRM)
- Gray area: Ask lawyer

ALWAYS:

□ Read employment agreement carefully
□ Consult lawyer if planning to compete
□ Document everything (if company sues, you need proof)
□ Don&#39;t solicit customers/employees (this WILL get you sued)
□ Build portable brand BEFORE you leave (12-month plan above)

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1: Ex-Gong VP Marketing
Non-compete: 12 months
Safe strategy:
- Month 1-12: Consulting on &quot;B2B marketing&quot; (not conversation intelligence specifically)
- Avoid: Sales tech companies (too close)
- Target: HR Tech, Fintech, SaaS infrastructure (different verticals)
- After 12 months: Join conversation intelligence competitor OR consult specifically in sales tech

Scenario 2: Ex-Fintech Employee
Non-compete: 6 months
Safe strategy:
- Month 1-6: Consulting on &quot;product management&quot; (not fintech-specific)
- Avoid: Fintech companies
- Target: E-commerce, SaaS, EdTech (different verticals)
- After 6 months: Join fintech competitor

Key: BE BORING for non-compete period
- Don&#39;t test boundaries
- Wait it out (6-12 months)
- Build broad brand meanwhile
