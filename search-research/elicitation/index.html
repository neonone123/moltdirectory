                  <h1>Elicitation</h1>
<p>Psychological profiling through natural conversation.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>When reviewing or creating content related to psychological elicitation—whether conversation scripts, interview questions, user research flows, or any code that implements these techniques—<strong>your goal is to achieve a 10/10 score</strong>.</p>
<p>Score all work on a 0-10 scale based on adherence to the principles and techniques in this skill. Provide your assessment as <strong>X/10</strong> with specific feedback on what&#39;s working and what needs improvement to reach 10/10.</p>
<p>A 10/10 means the work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embodies the core principle (depth through patience, not probing)</li>
<li>Uses appropriate techniques from the research traditions</li>
<li>Avoids all anti-patterns</li>
<li>Creates conditions for authentic self-disclosure</li>
</ul>
<p>Iterate until you reach 10/10.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Core Principle</h2>
<p><strong>Depth comes from patience, not probing.</strong></p>
<p>The most revealing information emerges when people feel safe to share, not when they&#39;re questioned. Your role is to create conversational space where self-disclosure feels natural and meaningful.</p>
<p>Key insight: People want to tell their stories. They rarely get the chance.</p>
<h2>Three Research Traditions</h2>
<p>This skill synthesizes three complementary approaches:</p>
<h3>1. Autobiographical Memory Research</h3>
<p>How memories shape identity. Key finding: <strong>Self-defining memories</strong> (Singer) are the building blocks of personality—vivid, emotionally intense, frequently rehearsed memories linked to enduring concerns.</p>
<h3>2. Narrative Identity Theory</h3>
<p>How people construct life stories. Key finding: The <strong>narrative themes</strong> people use (redemption vs. contamination, agency vs. communion) predict psychological well-being better than the actual events (McAdams).</p>
<h3>3. Motivational Interviewing</h3>
<p>How to facilitate disclosure without resistance. Key finding: <strong>Reflections outperform questions</strong> at eliciting authentic self-disclosure. Aim for 2:1 reflection-to-question ratio (Miller &amp; Rollnick).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Self-Defining Memories</h2>
<p>Jefferson Singer identified five criteria that make a memory &quot;self-defining&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vivid</strong> - Rich sensory and emotional detail</li>
<li><strong>Emotionally intense</strong> - Strong feeling, positive or negative</li>
<li><strong>Frequently rehearsed</strong> - Comes to mind often, told to others</li>
<li><strong>Linked to similar memories</strong> - Part of a pattern or theme</li>
<li><strong>Connected to enduring concerns</strong> - Reflects ongoing goals, conflicts, or unresolved issues</li>
</ol>
<h3>Eliciting Self-Defining Memories</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t ask: &quot;What&#39;s your most formative memory?&quot;</p>
<p>Instead, create conversational frames:</p>
<p><strong>The &quot;keeps coming back&quot; frame:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Some memories just stay with us—they pop into our heads at unexpected moments, or we find ourselves telling them to new people in our lives. Is there a memory like that for you?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The &quot;explains who I am&quot; frame:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When you&#39;re getting to know someone new and you want them to really understand where you&#39;re coming from, is there a story or moment you find yourself sharing?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The &quot;turning point&quot; frame:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Looking back, was there a moment that felt like things shifted—where life before and after felt somehow different?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Life Story Interview: 8 Key Scenes</h2>
<p>Dan McAdams&#39; Life Story Interview asks for 8 specific &quot;scenes&quot; that reveal narrative identity:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>High Point</strong> - Peak experience, most wonderful moment</li>
<li><strong>Low Point</strong> - Nadir, most difficult moment</li>
<li><strong>Turning Point</strong> - Moment of significant change</li>
<li><strong>Earliest Memory</strong> - First clear memory</li>
<li><strong>Important Childhood Memory</strong> - Vivid memory before age 12</li>
<li><strong>Important Adolescent Memory</strong> - Vivid memory from teen years</li>
<li><strong>Important Adult Memory</strong> - Significant recent memory</li>
<li><strong>One Other Important Memory</strong> - Anything else that defines who they are</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conversational Adaptations</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t need to ask all 8 sequentially. Instead:</p>
<p><strong>Open with curiosity, not agenda:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m curious about the moments that shaped you. Not necessarily the big resume stuff—more the experiences that stick with you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Follow their lead:</strong>
When they mention a period of life, gently explore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What was that time like for you? Any particular moments that stand out?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bridge across time:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That sounds like it mattered. Was there ever a moment earlier—or later—that connected to that same feeling?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Narrative Themes to Listen For</h3>
<p><strong>Agency themes</strong> (personal power, achievement, mastery):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I decided...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I made it happen...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I pushed through...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communion themes</strong> (connection, love, belonging):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We were all together...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I felt so close to...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;They understood me...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Redemption sequences</strong> (suffering leads to growth):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;It was terrible, but...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Looking back, I&#39;m glad...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That&#39;s what made me who I am...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contamination sequences</strong> (good becomes bad):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Things were great until...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I thought I was happy, but...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It ruined everything...&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>OARS Framework</h2>
<p>Motivational Interviewing&#39;s core skills, adapted for elicitation:</p>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<p>Questions that can&#39;t be answered with yes/no. But use sparingly.</p>
<p>Instead of: &quot;Did you like your childhood?&quot;
Try: &quot;What was it like growing up in your family?&quot;</p>
<h3>Affirmations</h3>
<p>Genuine recognition of strengths, efforts, or values—not compliments.</p>
<p>Instead of: &quot;That&#39;s great!&quot;
Try: &quot;You valued honesty even when it was costly.&quot;</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>Restate or reframe what they said. This is the core skill.</p>
<p><strong>Simple reflection</strong> (repeat back):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So you felt invisible in that moment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Complex reflection</strong> (add meaning):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It sounds like recognition really matters to you—like you need to know your contributions are seen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Amplified reflection</strong> (gently exaggerate):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So nothing they could have done would have made a difference.&quot; (Often prompts them to nuance their position)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Double-sided reflection</strong> (hold both truths):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;On one hand, you loved the stability. On the other, you felt trapped.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Summaries</h3>
<p>Periodically gather what you&#39;ve heard. Creates meaning and invites correction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let me see if I&#39;m following: Growing up, you learned to be self-reliant because asking for help meant disappointment. But you&#39;ve also noticed that pattern keeping people at a distance now. And you&#39;re wondering if there&#39;s another way.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The 2:1 Ratio</h3>
<p><strong>Aim for 2 reflections for every question.</strong></p>
<p>Questions gather information but can feel like interrogation. Reflections show understanding and invite elaboration.</p>
<p>Bad pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: &quot;What happened?&quot; → Q: &quot;How did that feel?&quot; → Q: &quot;What did you do next?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: &quot;What happened?&quot; → R: &quot;That caught you off guard&quot; → R: &quot;You weren&#39;t sure what to make of it&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Opposite day technique:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What kind of person could you never be? What would feel like a betrayal of yourself?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Decision archaeology:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Think of a hard choice you made. What ultimately tipped the scales?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Anger as values signal:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What makes you genuinely angry—not annoyed, but morally outraged?&quot;</p>

<h2>Schema Detection</h2>
<p>Jeffrey Young&#39;s 18 Early Maladaptive Schemas are stable patterns of thinking and feeling that develop in childhood and persist across contexts:</p>
<h3>The Five Domains</h3>
<p><strong>1. Disconnection &amp; Rejection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Abandonment, Mistrust/Abuse, Emotional Deprivation, Defectiveness/Shame, Social Isolation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Impaired Autonomy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dependence/Incompetence, Vulnerability to Harm, Enmeshment, Failure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Impaired Limits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entitlement/Grandiosity, Insufficient Self-Control</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Other-Directedness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subjugation, Self-Sacrifice, Approval-Seeking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Overvigilance &amp; Inhibition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Negativity/Pessimism, Emotional Inhibition, Unrelenting Standards, Punitiveness</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downward Arrow Technique</h3>
<p>When someone expresses a surface concern, gently probe for the deeper belief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person: &quot;I&#39;m worried about the presentation.&quot;
You: &quot;What&#39;s the worst that could happen?&quot;
Person: &quot;I could mess up in front of everyone.&quot;
You: &quot;And if that happened, what would that mean?&quot;
Person: &quot;They&#39;d see I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;
You: &quot;And what would that mean about you?&quot;
Person: &quot;That I&#39;m a fraud. That I don&#39;t deserve to be here.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottom of the arrow often reveals a schema (in this case: Defectiveness/Shame or Failure).</p>

<h2>The Reminiscence Bump</h2>
<p>People have disproportionately more and more vivid memories from ages 10-30 (the &quot;reminiscence bump&quot;). This is when identity forms.</p>
<p><strong>Target the bump:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First romantic relationship</li>
<li>First job or career defining moment</li>
<li>Leaving home</li>
<li>Key friendships formed</li>
<li>Educational turning points</li>
<li>Early adult struggles and triumphs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bridge from present to bump:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You mentioned feeling like an outsider at work. Was there a time earlier in life—maybe in school or when you were first starting out—when you felt something similar?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h3>Critical Caveats</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Context matters enormously.</strong> The same word patterns mean different things in different contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-validate.</strong> Never rely on language alone. Triangulate with behavior and explicit statements.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregates, not individuals.</strong> LIWC findings are about group averages. Individual variation is huge.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural differences.</strong> Word usage norms vary dramatically across cultures and languages.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Anti-Patterns</h2>
<p><strong>What NOT to do:</strong></p>
<h3>The Interrogation Trap</h3>
<p>Rapid-fire questions feel like an interview, not a conversation. People become guarded.</p>
<p>Instead: Slow down. Reflect more, question less.</p>
<h3>The Interpretation Leap</h3>
<p>Jumping to psychological conclusions before you have evidence.</p>
<p>Instead: Hold hypotheses lightly. Seek disconfirming evidence.</p>
<h3>The Agenda Push</h3>
<p>Steering toward topics you think are important rather than following their energy.</p>
<p>Instead: Let them lead. Their emphasis is data.</p>
<h3>The Premature Depth</h3>
<p>Asking deeply personal questions before trust is established.</p>
<p>Instead: Earn disclosure gradually. Start with easier territory.</p>
<h3>The Therapy Cosplay</h3>
<p>Using clinical language or techniques that imply you&#39;re treating them.</p>
<p>Instead: Be curious, not clinical. You&#39;re learning about them, not diagnosing.</p>
<h3>The Monologue Response</h3>
<p>Responding to their disclosure with your own lengthy story.</p>
<p>Instead: Keep focus on them. Brief self-disclosure can build rapport, but always return to them.</p>
<h3>The Validation Trap</h3>
<p>Agreeing with everything to maintain rapport.</p>
<p>Instead: Genuine reflections can gently challenge without confrontation.</p>
